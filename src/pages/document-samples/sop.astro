Statement of Purpose

Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to express my keen interest in pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at [University Name]. With a strong academic background in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University and three years of professional experience as a software developer, I am confident that this program aligns perfectly with my career aspirations.

During my undergraduate studies, I maintained a GPA of 3.8/4.0 and developed a particular interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My final year project on "Deep Learning Applications in Natural Language Processing" received the best project award and was published in the university's technical journal.

My professional experience at [Company Name] has given me practical exposure to real-world software development challenges and strengthened my resolve to pursue advanced studies in this field. I have been particularly involved in developing scalable web applications and implementing machine learning algorithms for data analysis.

I am drawn to [University Name]'s program because of its strong focus on research and innovation, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence and distributed systems. Professor [Name]'s work on [specific research area] especially interests me, and I hope to contribute to similar groundbreaking research under their guidance.

[Continue with career goals and future plans...]

Sincerely,
[Your Name]</pre>
